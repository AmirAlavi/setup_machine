# setup_machine
This repository stores all of my configuration files (dotfiles) for various tools
as well as scripts to install those tools.

It is meant to be used to automatically setup a fresh machine to my liking, and
to be cloned on all of my machines so that they can be kept in sync.

To use, run the script at the root of the repo
